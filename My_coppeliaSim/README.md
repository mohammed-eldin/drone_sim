# Coppelia Rail Simulation
Simulation of a UAV on a rail section with obstacles. The scene to use is `base_drone_scene`.

## Notes for use 
ROS custom messages need to be added manually in coppelia: You can use the coppelia of this repository directly or you can replace the file 'libsimExtROS.so' of your coppelia with the one in this repository.

## How to run it
Download the repo in your linux PC, execute the script `coppeliaSim.sh`

## Note
This simulation is part of my master thesis project, for more info see the correspondant chapter of the written paper.
